## Project-Euler solutions 

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematics problems that can be solved programatically. it get harder as you proceed along with the answers. These solutions are the result of my shameless attempts with python, mostly brute force. this helps in exploring limitations of primitive types, control flow and oppertunity to use recursion.
